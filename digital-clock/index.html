        What is importance of time in our life?
        Time is so important, in fact, that if you did not have any, you could not do anything at all. There are many things that we can do with our time: We can spend it on leisure activities, such as sleeping, watching TV, reading or going for a walk; on work or study; on raising a family; or on helping others.
